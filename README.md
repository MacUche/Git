INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
In this project, various SQL Queries were used to extract different information  from the Northwind database. 


SQL Commands
The following SQL Commands were applied in this project
1.	A few ‘WHERE IN’ and ‘WHERE LIKE’ clauses were applied at the beginning of section 1. Then Group by, Order by, Having and JOINs were used in later sub questions. It is good to note that a 5 JOIN was used on question 1.6. In summary, all the queries used on all the sub questions in 1 were DML queries. This means they  are all used to Manipulate a database nothing more. 
2.	This section of the project used DDL commands (Data Definition Language). 2.1 used a ‘CREATE’ query to create a Database before going on to Create a table in the MacSQLq2_db Database. 2.2 Then went on to use an ‘INSERT’ query to populate the table. 
3.	This section focused mostly on using JOINS, ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING to manipulate the query. It also only used DML commands (Data Manipulation Language) . 3.4 used something called a ‘Sub query’ to get the required output. Also, it should be noted that both 3.2 and 3.4 involved using a excel to plot the graphs of the output.
